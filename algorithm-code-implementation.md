# Signal-Based Object Detection Algorithm Analysis

After reviewing your implementation of a signal-based object detection algorithm, I've identified several issues that are affecting its performance and accuracy. Here's my analysis along with recommended fixes.

## DIAGNOSIS

### 1. Computational Inefficiency in `compute_weights`
The weight computation has nested loops over grid cells and then another loop over particles with O(nÂ³) complexity which creates a severe performance bottleneck.

```python
# Nested loops for computing z_grid
for i in range(num_r):
    for j in range(num_theta):
        # ...
        
# Another nested loop for computing marker weights
for idx in range(len(markers_state2)):
    # ...
    for i in range(num_r):
        for j in range(num_theta):
            # ...
```

### 2. Inconsistent State Management
At the end of each iteration, all particles not in state 2 are discarded:

```python
state2_mask = states == 2
markers = markers[state2_mask]
states = states[state2_mask]
```

This removes all state 1 particles, which contradicts proper particle filter behavior where different particle states should be maintained throughout iterations.

### 3. Movement Model Inconsistencies
Multiple movement functions are defined (`move_clockwise`, `move_noise_markers`, `move_object_signals`) but only `update_markers` is called in the main loop.

### 4. Visualization Inefficiency
The `visualize` function creates new plot windows at each iteration, potentially causing performance and memory issues.

### 5. Numerical Stability Risk
Weight normalization could face numerical stability issues:

```python
total_weight = np.sum(marker_weights)
if total_weight > 0:
    marker_weights /= total_weight
else:
    marker_weights = np.ones(len(marker_weights)) / len(marker_weights)
```

## SOLUTION

### 1. Vectorize Computation for Performance

```python
def compute_weights_vectorized(self, markers, states):
    state2_mask = (states == 2)
    if not np.any(state2_mask):
        return np.array([])
    
    markers_state2 = markers[state2_mask]
    x, y = markers_state2[:, 0], markers_state2[:, 1]
    amplitudes = markers_state2[:, 2]
    r_signals = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
    theta_signals = np.arctan2(y, x)
    theta_signals = np.where(theta_signals < 0, theta_signals + 2*np.pi, theta_signals)
    
    # Grid parameters
    num_r, num_theta = 50, 120
    r_edges = np.linspace(0, self.search_radius, num_r+1)
    theta_edges = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, num_theta+1)
    r_centers = (r_edges[:-1] + r_edges[1:]) / 2
    theta_centers = (theta_edges[:-1] + theta_edges[1:]) / 2
    
    # Create meshgrid for vectorization
    R_c, Theta_c = np.meshgrid(r_centers, theta_centers, indexing='ij')
    
    # Vectorized distance calculation
    d = np.zeros((num_r, num_theta, len(r_signals)))
    for i in range(num_r):
        for j in range(num_theta):
            d[i, j, :] = np.sqrt(
                R_c[i, j]**2 + 
                r_signals**2 - 
                2 * R_c[i, j] * r_signals * np.cos(Theta_c[i, j] - theta_signals)
            )
    
    # The rest of the calculation can be similarly vectorized
    # ...
```

### 2. Fix State Management

```python
def run_detection(self, num_iterations=200, dt=1):
    markers, states, object_indices = self.initialize_markers()
    
    for t in range(num_iterations):
        # Count current markers
        current_count = len(markers)
        
        # Generate new markers to maintain desired number
        new_markers, new_states = self.generate_new_markers(current_count)
        if len(new_markers) > 0:
            markers = np.vstack((markers, new_markers))
            states = np.hstack((states, new_states))
        
        # Update states
        states = self.update_states(states)
        
        # Weight computation and position estimation for state 2 markers
        state2_mask = states == 2
        if np.any(state2_mask):
            weights = self.compute_weights(markers, states)
            self.current_center, P = self.compute_position_gaussian(markers, states, weights, t)
            
            # Resample only state 2 markers
            state2_indices = np.where(state2_mask)[0]
            state2_markers = markers[state2_mask]
            new_state2_markers = self.multinomial_resampling(state2_markers, weights)
            markers[state2_indices] = new_state2_markers
        
        # Update positions for all markers
        markers = self.update_markers(markers, states, dt, self.current_center, self.center_prev, t)
        self.center_prev = self.current_center
        
        # Visualize
        if t % 10 == 0 or (P is not None and P >= 0.9):
            self.visualize(markers, states, t, self.current_center)
        
        # DO NOT discard state 1 particles - instead limit total number
        if len(markers) > self.M * 1.5:  # Set a reasonable limit
            # Keep all state 2 and randomly sample state 1
            indices_state2 = np.where(states == 2)[0]
            indices_state1 = np.where(states == 1)[0]
            keep_indices_state1 = np.random.choice(
                indices_state1, 
                min(len(indices_state1), self.M - len(indices_state2)), 
                replace=False
            )
            keep_indices = np.concatenate((indices_state2, keep_indices_state1))
            markers = markers[keep_indices]
            states = states[keep_indices]
    
    return markers, states
```

### 3. Unified Movement Model

```python
def update_all_markers(self, markers, states, dt):
    """Unified marker movement function"""
    # Add random movement to all markers
    noise = np.random.normal(0, self.noise_std, size=(len(markers), 2))
    markers[:, :2] += noise * dt
    
    # Constrain to search radius
    r = np.linalg.norm(markers[:, :2], axis=1)
    over_radius = r > self.search_radius
    if np.any(over_radius):
        markers[over_radius, :2] *= self.search_radius / r[over_radius, np.newaxis]
    
    return markers
```

### 4. Improved Visualization

```python
def visualize(self, markers, states, iteration, center_of_mass=None):
    # Clear previous plots instead of creating new windows
    plt.clf()
    
    # Create figure once and reuse
    if not hasattr(self, 'fig'):
        self.fig, (self.ax1, self.ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(15, 6))
    else:
        self.ax1.clear()
        self.ax2.clear()
    
    # Rest of visualization code...
    
    plt.pause(0.01)  # Update display
```

### 5. Numerical Stability Enhancement

```python
def normalize_weights(self, weights):
    epsilon = 1e-10  # Small value to avoid division by zero
    total_weight = np.sum(weights)
    if total_weight > epsilon:
        return weights / total_weight
    else:
        return np.ones_like(weights) / len(weights)
```

## MATHEMATICAL DOCUMENTATION

## Implementation Improvement Recommendations

Based on the analysis, here are the key improvements to make to your code:

1. **Vectorize computation-intensive parts** - The nested loops in weight calculation cause a performance bottleneck. Implement NumPy's vectorized operations where possible.

2. **Fix particle lifecycle management** - Maintain both state 1 and state 2 particles throughout iterations instead of discarding all state 1 particles at the end of each cycle. This preserves the particle diversity essential for exploration.

3. **Implement a unified movement model** - Create a single consistent function for updating particle positions rather than having multiple unused movement functions.

4. **Improve visualization efficiency** - Modify the visualization to reuse plot windows instead of creating new ones each time.

5. **Add numerical stability safeguards** - Add small epsilon values to prevent division by zero and other numerical issues.

These changes will significantly improve both the performance and accuracy of your algorithm. The most important conceptual fix is properly maintaining both types of particles throughout the iterations while still managing the total particle count, as this is fundamental to how particle filters operate.
